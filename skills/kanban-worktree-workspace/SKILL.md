# Kanban Worktree Workspace Strategy

## When to Use

- You want all kanban tasks to use git worktree workspaces by default (not
  scratch or dir) for persistence and parallel execution
- You need to initialize a main git repo as the worktree base
- You're updating global_kanban_rules.md or orchestrator_rules.md to change
  the default workspace_kind

## Overview

By default, Hermes kanban tasks use `workspace_kind="scratch"` (disposable
temp directories). This means task outputs are lost after the workspace is
cleaned. Switching the default to `workspace_kind="worktree"` gives each
task its own git branch — outputs are persisted as git commits, multiple
tasks run in parallel without file conflicts, and the work can be reviewed
or merged after completion.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Initialize the Main Git Repo

The worktree base must be a git repository. Initialize it before changing
the default workspace_kind:

```bash
cd ~/hermes-docker-sandbox/workspace
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "init: base repo for kanban worktree workspaces"
# Add .gitignore to exclude build artifacts
cat > .gitignore << 'EOF'
*.pyc
__pycache__/
.DS_Store
nohup.out
*.log
.venv/
EOF
git add .gitignore && git commit -m "chore: add .gitignore"
```

The main repo path (`~/hermes-docker-sandbox/workspace/`) is referenced in
`global_kanban_rules.md` and `orchestrator_rules.md` as the worktree base.

### 2. Understand Hermes Worktree Mechanics

When `workspace_kind="worktree"` is set on a kanban task:
- The dispatcher creates `.worktrees/<task-id>/` under the main repo
- A branch `wt/<task-id>` (or `<project-slug>/<task-id>` with project) is
  created and checked out in the worktree
- The worker's `$HERMES_KANBAN_WORKSPACE` points to this directory
- The worker operates in a full git working copy on its own branch

## Files to Update (3 files)

### File 1: `~/.hermes/global_kanban_rules.md`

This is the shared rules file loaded by all agents. Change the default
`workspace_kind` from `"dir"` to `"worktree"`:

Key changes:
- Default value: `workspace_kind="worktree"` (was `"dir"`)
- `workspace_path` no longer needed for worktree mode (system auto-creates
  `.worktrees/<task-id>` under the main repo)
- `workspace_kind="dir"` becomes a special-case option for non-Git tasks
- Add a "Worktree Working Mechanism" section explaining persistence +
  parallel execution benefits
- Bump rule version (e.g. v1.1 → v2.0)

### File 2: `~/.hermes/profiles/orchestrator/orchestrator_rules.md`

The orchestrator's rules file mirrors the global rules. Update §3.5
"workspace 类型设置" with the same changes:

- Default: `workspace_kind="worktree"`
- Add §3.5.3 "Worktree 持久化与并行执行" explaining:
  - Persistence: git commits on independent branches survive workspace cleanup
  - Parallel: multiple tasks on separate branches, no file conflicts
- Update ALL code examples: `workspace_kind="dir"` → `workspace_kind="worktree"`
- Update version annotation at the bottom

### File 3: `~/.hermes/profiles/orchestrator/email_kanban_rules.md`

If email routing creates kanban tasks, update its code examples too:
- `workspace_kind="dir"` → `workspace_kind="worktree"` in all examples

## Example Rule Text for global_kanban_rules.md

```markdown
## workspace_kind 强制规则

所有 kanban 任务创建时，必须显式设置 workspace_kind 参数。

### ❌ 禁止项
- workspace_kind="scratch" — 不允许

### ✅ 默认值
- workspace_kind="worktree" — 默认值，Git worktree 模式，支持持久化和并行执行

### Worktree 工作机制

主仓库路径: ~/hermes-docker-sandbox/workspace/（已初始化 Git 仓库）

任务被 dispatch 时，系统自动在主仓库下创建 .worktrees/<task-id> 子目录
和对应分支。Worker 的 git 提交保留在独立分支上，workspace 清理后仍可恢复。
多个任务各自在独立分支上并行工作，互不干扰。
```

## Worker Discipline in Worktree Mode

Workers entering a worktree workspace should:
1. `cd $HERMES_KANBAN_WORKSPACE` — enter the worktree directory
2. The directory is a full git working copy on an independent branch
3. Encourage `git add` + `git commit` for intermediate outputs
4. At task completion, outputs are on the worktree branch — reviewable via
   `git log` / `git diff`
5. Merging back to main branch is by orchestrator/reviewer decision

## Pitfall: board.json default_workdir must not be null

If `default_workdir` is `null` in a board's `board.json`, ALL
`workspace_kind="worktree"` tasks will fail immediately with:

```
workspace: task <id> has workspace_kind=worktree but no workspace_path,
and board '<slug>' has no default_workdir set.
```

The dispatcher retries until the failure limit is exhausted, then marks
the task `gave_up`. This is the #1 cause of worktree task failures.

**Always verify default_workdir when setting up a new board:**

```python
import json, pathlib
for slug in ["swarm", "hack", "product", "ops", "eda"]:
    p = pathlib.Path.home() / f".hermes/kanban/boards/{slug}/board.json"
    if p.exists():
        d = json.loads(p.read_text())
        dw = d.get("default_workdir")
        status = "✅" if dw else "❌ NULL — fix immediately"
        print(f"  {slug}: default_workdir = {dw or 'NULL'} {status}")
```

Fix:
```python
d["default_workdir"] = str(pathlib.Path.home() / "hermes-docker-sandbox/workspace")
p.write_text(json.dumps(d, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2))
```

This pitfall was observed on the swarm board (2026-07-26): `default_workdir`
was `null` while hack/product/ops boards were correctly set. The task
`t_ccad1e56` burned both retry attempts on spawn_failed before the
root cause was identified.

## Root-Cause Fix: API Default (Source Patch)

The board-level fixes above only help when an agent explicitly sets
`workspace_kind="worktree"`. But the **API default** in the Hermes source
is `workspace_kind="scratch"`:

- `tools/kanban_tools.py:1247` — `if workspace_kind is None: workspace_kind = "scratch"`
- `hermes_cli/kanban_db.py:2888` — `create_task(..., workspace_kind: str = "scratch")`
- `hermes_cli/kanban_swarm.py:89` — `create_swarm(..., workspace_kind: str = "scratch")`
- `hermes_cli/kanban_db.py:6164` — child inheritance fallback `or "scratch"`
- `hermes_cli/kanban_db.py:6633` — resolve_workspace fallback `or "scratch"`

Any agent that omits `workspace_kind` (and the rules docs as written)
silently gets scratch — output deleted on completion. To fix this at the
root, patch all five defaults from `"scratch"` to `"worktree"`. The patch
is protected against `hermes update` by
`~/.hermes/patches/apply-kanban-worktree-default.sh` (idempotent,
signature-checked) wired into `post-update-hook.sh` §3.

**Do NOT patch line ~5533** (`(workspace_kind or "scratch") != "scratch"`)
— that's the scratch-tip emitter and correctly defaults to scratch.

## Pitfall: SwarmStudio desktop gateway uses BUNDLED python (not venv)

The SwarmStudio desktop app spawns its gateway process with a **frozen,
bundled** Python runtime — NOT the `~/.hermes/hermes-agent/venv/` python.
Any source patch to `~/.hermes/hermes-agent/` is invisible to the
SwarmStudio gateway process.

```
~/.hermes-web-ui/desktop-runtime/hermes/<version>/mac-arm64/
  python/bin/python3                                  ← bundled interpreter
  python/lib/python3.12/site-packages/
    hermes_cli/kanban_db.py                           ← FROZEN COPY (separate)
    hermes_cli/kanban_swarm.py
    tools/kanban_tools.py
```

The venv-managed gateway (e.g. a launchd-spawned profile gateway) DOES
read from `~/.hermes/hermes-agent/`. But the SwarmStudio-managed unified
gateway @ port 8650 imports from the bundled site-packages. **You must
patch BOTH copies.**

Verify which python each running gateway uses:

```bash
# Check the gateway process command line
ps aux | grep 'gateway run' | grep -v grep
#   venv gateway:     .../hermes-agent/venv/bin/python -m hermes_cli.main ...
#   SwarmStudio:      .../desktop-runtime/.../python/bin/python3 -m hermes_cli.main ...

# Confirm the import source for a given interpreter
<path-to-python> -c "from hermes_cli.kanban_db import create_task; import inspect; \
  print(inspect.signature(create_task).parameters['workspace_kind'].default)"
```

The `apply-kanban-worktree-default.sh` patch script covers BOTH paths
(venv + desktop-runtime) — section 4 iterates every version under
`~/.hermes-web-ui/desktop-runtime/hermes/*/` and patches the bundled
site-packages. The `post-update-hook.sh` §3 signature check probes both
locations before deciding to re-apply.

## When to Use dir Instead

`workspace_kind="dir"` remains valid for:
- Non-Git tasks (file operations, data processing)
- Tasks needing a fixed shared path
- Temporary file operations that don't need version control

## Interaction with Docker Terminal Backend

When `terminal.backend: docker` is enabled (privacy hardening), worktree
workspaces work seamlessly — the Docker container mounts the entire
`~/hermes-docker-sandbox/workspace/` directory, which includes `.worktrees/`.
Workers operate inside the container on their worktree branch without
any special configuration.

The Docker volume mount in config.yaml:
```yaml
terminal:
  docker:
    volumes:
      - ~/hermes-docker-sandbox/workspace:/opt/workspace
```

This mounts the git main repo AND all worktrees. Workers `cd` into their
`$HERMES_KANBAN_WORKSPACE` (which resolves to a `.worktrees/<task-id>/` path)
and operate normally inside the container.
